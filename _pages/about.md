Hey! I'm Phil, a Senior Technical Designer at Wushu Studios. I have 6+ years of experience developing in Unreal Engine 4 Blueprint and C++. I occasionally venture into Unity and Godot. The contents of this blog will be a mixture of engine specific tips, best practices, technical design woes and personal devlogs. Thanks for showing an interest and I hope you learn something new here!
